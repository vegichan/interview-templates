# interview-templates
This is a collection of interview templates. Candidates extend some of the classes provided in the project. Each project has a set of tests that can be run to resolve any ambiguity in the specification of the task. You are allowed to extend the tests and are actually encouraged to do so as you might catch any extreme cases you might think of.

Please do not fork this repository with solutions.

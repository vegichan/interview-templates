/*
 *  TODO: implement the binary search tree in this file.
 *  - inherit AbstractBinaryTree
 *  - test edge cases
 *  - prevent resource leaks
 *  - try to follow the code formatting rules of Driver.cpp
 *
 *  we would like to see the following aspects:
 *  - completness
 *  - readability
 *  - low error ratio
 *  - use of C++11 features
 *
 *  we would NOT like to see the following aspects:
 *  - smartness
 *  - obfuscation
 *
 *  due to the limited scope of the task, we will not assess:
 *  - optimal speed
 *  - optimal space 
 *
 *  when in doubt prefer READABILITY.
